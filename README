Hi,

Big Blue Bus Schedule is a fast, lightweight and easy-to-use app for looking up
bus schedules of Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines, a.k.a. the Big Blue Bus.

The app helps bus commuters in westside region of Los Angeles to find the
schedule of next bus in just a second. The app includes 14 regular BBB lines and
three special lines (Rapid 3, Rapid 7 and Super 12).

The app is a perfect replacement for BBB bus brochures. Timetables and stop
lists are displayed in a user-friendly way. The next available bus will be
automatically highlighted based on the current time and date.

The app can be used without internet connection.

Thanks for your interest.
Zeiga
